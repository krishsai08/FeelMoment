Blog Website
This is a full-stack blog application built using the MERN stack. Users can write and publish blog posts, and other users can leave comments on those posts. Comments can be edited or deleted by the users who posted them.

Users can also view all their own blog posts by visiting their profile page, where they have the option to update their email address and password.

The frontend is developed using ReactJS, with styling handled by HTML, CSS, and the Tailwind CSS framework. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, while MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud-based database for storing and accessing data.
